# jcrunch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pfichtner/jcrunch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pfichtner/jcrunch)

A wordlist generator written in 100% Java, very similar to [crunch](http://crunch-wordlist.sourceforge.net) 

## Features
* crunch generates wordlists in permutation way only
* resume support
* pattern supports all numbers, symbols, upper and lower case characters 
* permutation prediction on first line (can be disabled)

## Enhanced features compared to crunch
* order of charset content can be chosen freely

## Subset of features missing compared to crunch
* splitting (use a pipe and "split" for that)
* inverting (use a pipe and "rev" for that)
* limit duplicate characters
